      <h2>Our Values and Philosophy</h2>
      <h4>At Ria, we are guided by three core values:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong className="text-info">Respect for Time:</strong> We believe your time is precious.
          Our platform is designed to efficiently navigate you to compatible
          matches, avoiding the clutter of endless browsing.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong className="text-info">Depth in Connections:</strong> We prioritize depth over
          breadth. Ria focuses on the quality of matches, not the quantity,
          enabling more meaningful relationships that are built to last.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong className="text-info">Safety and Privacy:</strong> In the world of online dating,
          your safety and privacy are paramount. We are committed to maintaining
          the highest standards of security and confidentiality, ensuring you
          can search for love with peace of mind.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Our philosophy is simple: every significant connection should start with
        trust and a deep understanding of each other's values and desires. Ria
        empowers you to find exactly that, transforming the landscape of online
        dating into a more fruitful and less daunting experience.
