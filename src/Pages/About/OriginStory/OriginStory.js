        After witnessing countless friends and family members navigate the
        frustrating world of online dating — spending hours swiping left and
        right only to end up more disheartened and lonely than when they
        started—our team decided it was time for a change. The Ria team
        envisioned a dating platform that valued quality over quantity, one that
        would save time by focusing on meaningful connections rather than
        endless options. With a background in psychology and a passionate team
        of engineers and relationship experts, the Ria team set out to create a
        dating site that uses advanced matching algorithms to bring people
        together based on deep compatibility, not just superficial traits. Thus,
        Ria (Rishta Interactions Assistant) was born — a platform where every
        single connection has potential.
